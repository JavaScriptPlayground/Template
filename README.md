## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> There is currently an issue with the global variable `document`. [Link to issue.](https://github.com/denoland/deno_lint/issues/590)

### Getting started
Checkout the template and run initial [`deno task cache`](#tasks). This will cache all the necessary dependencies.
If you still getting import errors, try reloading the "import registries cache".

Next you can build your app using [`deno task build`](#tasks).

After that your app is ready to serve by using [`deno task serve`](#tasks).

### Tasks
Use `deno task <name_of_the_task>`:

- `build` Build the page. *(recommended)*
- `build:watch` Build the page with active file watcher. *(recommended)*
- `build:dev` Build the page for development (without optimization like minification).
- `build:dev:watch` Build the page for development (without optimization like minification) with active file watcher.
- `cache` Cache all dependencies.
- `serve` Serve the build `dist` directory as the page root. *(recommended)*
- `serve:dev` Serve the build `dist` directory as the page root for development (with verbose logging and directory listing enabled).
- `lint` Lint the sourcecode
- `test` Test your sourcecode (all `.test.ts` file will be checked). A junit report gets generated to `./reports/report.xml`

### GitHub Workflows
- `deployment.yml` Deploys your current app to GitHub Pages if the name of your repository ends with `.github.io`. (Ex. `github.com/foo/foo.github.io`)
- `lint.yml` Lints your sourcecode.
- `test.yml` Runs all the unit tests.
